Use the `/professional` skill for professional responsibility, ethics, estimates, and commitments.

## Modes

### Evaluate Mode (default)

When assessing whether code or practices meet professional standards:

1. Read the `/professional` skill
2. Check against the Programmer's Oath — does the code demonstrate each promise?
3. Assess harm potential — to society, function, and structure
4. Check the two values of software — is structure preserved alongside behavior?
5. Verify tests exist (Promise 3 — quick, sure, repeatable proof)
6. Flag any professional responsibility gaps

### Estimate Mode

When helping with estimation or reviewing estimates:

1. Read the `/professional` skill
2. Read `references/extended-examples.md` for PERT examples and estimation stories
3. Ensure estimates are ranges, not single dates
4. Apply PERT three-point estimation if appropriate
5. Check for backwards-constructed estimates (starting from deadline)
6. Advise on communicating uncertainty honestly
7. Warn against committing without certainty

### Advise Mode

When guiding professional conduct decisions (saying no, handling pressure, ethical dilemmas):

1. Read the `/professional` skill
2. Read `references/extended-examples.md` for case studies
3. Apply the relevant professional responsibility principles
4. Use case studies (VW, Knight Capital, Toyota, healthcare.gov) to illustrate consequences
5. Provide concrete language for saying no, communicating uncertainty, or raising concerns
6. Distinguish between estimates and commitments

### Teach Mode

When explaining professional standards or the coming reckoning:

1. Read the `/professional` skill
2. Read `references/extended-examples.md` for full case studies and industry history
3. Walk through the Programmer's Oath with concrete examples
4. Use the VW/Knight Capital/Toyota stories to illustrate "do no harm"
5. Explain the estimation spectrum (accuracy vs precision, PERT, fudge factors)
6. Present the coming reckoning argument and the case for self-regulation

## Key Reminders

- **Know what your code does.** The first promise. If you don't know, you can't guarantee no harm.
- **Estimates are not commitments.** Ranges, not dates. Probabilities, not promises.
- **Say no when you should.** You were hired for your ability to say no — it saves more than it costs.
- **Speak up.** Passive-aggressive silence when you know something is wrong is a professional failure.
- **Structure matters as much as behavior.** Program B (easy to change, doesn't work yet) beats Program A (works perfectly, impossible to change).
